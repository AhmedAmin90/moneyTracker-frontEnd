# Money Tracker Application

 
> This is a Final capstone project in Microverse. This is a money tracker application for tracking expenses for unlimited items for each user.  

# In this application:
- The user can create an account with only a username and password.
- After creating an account, the user will find instructions on who to add new items.
- The user can start adding items and things that (he/she) needs to track expenses on this item. For example transportation, restaurants, kids .. etc.
- The user dashboard contains a list of all items that the user-created when the user clicks on this item the user will introduce to a single page of each item with all expenses with the date of each expense.
- The user can add another expense from two places: Add expenses page which the user will find a list of all items and (he/she) will select the item and add the expense or from the single page.
- At the top of each page the user will find the total of all expenses.
